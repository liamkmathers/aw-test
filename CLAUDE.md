## Workflow (every task)
1. Read `tasks/<ID>.md` before touching code. If no task file exists for what you were asked, draft one from `tasks/TEMPLATE.md`, show it, and stop for confirmation.
2. Start in plan mode. Write `tasks/<ID>.plan.md` from `tasks/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`. Wait for approval before editing code.
3. Work on branch `task/<ID>` in its own worktree. Commit in small steps.
4. Keep the plan current: mark the step you are on `[~]`, done steps `[x]`. If the diff departs from the plan, update the plan in the same commit.
5. When you notice a discrepancy, a surprise, or a decision mid-task, write it as its own line in your message, starting with `NOTE:` at column one. Not inside a file, not inside backticks. Hooks collect these; `/pr` writes them to `tasks/<ID>.log.md`.
6. Edit repo files with the Write and Edit tools, never with shell redirection, `sed -i`, or scripts. Hooks only see tool edits.
7. `kind: fix` tasks: write the failing test first, run it, confirm it fails for the expected reason, commit it. Then fix the code. Test files are frozen after that commit (a hook enforces this).
8. `kind: feature` tasks: invoke `test-writer` with the task ID and the interface before implementing.
9. `kind: chore` tasks (CI, config, docs): no test-first; the verifier still runs.
10. If a frozen test or an approved plan turns out to be wrong, stop. Write a `NOTE:`, report it under Not done, and wait. Do not work around it.
11. If the change makes a page in `docs/wiki/` false, fix that page in the same commit. New "why" decisions go through `/decide`.
12. When done, invoke `verifier` with the task ID. Then run `/pr`. Then stop.
13. Never push to main. Never merge. Never approve a PR. Never edit `tasks/<ID>.verify.md` by hand.
